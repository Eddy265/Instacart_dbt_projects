# Data Transformation Pipeline Using Data Build Tool (dbt)
Project Description:

The Instacart DBT project is a comprehensive data transformation pipeline that focuses on transforming raw data into actionable insights. As part of this project, I have developed a Python script that simulates real-life transactional data. The script is designed and automated to insert 5 rows of random data into the order table every minute, effectively mimicking the dynamic nature of transactions in a retail store. The final model outputs are stored in a database connected to a Tableau dashboard. I have designed this dashboard to present business insights in a visually appealing and interactive manner. With the power of Tableau's data visualization capabilities, stakeholders can explore and interact with the data, gaining deeper insights and making more informed decisions. The project consists of four main models designed to calculate essential metrics and generate valuable outputs.

**1. Customer Analysis:**
   This model combines data from the products, orders, and customers tables to analyze customer preferences, spending patterns, and lifetime value. It calculates the most preferred product for each customer, their churn status, total spend, average spend, and customer segment based on their purchase behavior. The model also determines if customers are high-value, low-value, frequent, or occasional purchasers.

**2. Monthly Revenue and Profit:**
   This model aggregates the revenue and profit generated by the Instacart platform on a monthly basis. It provides a snapshot of the overall financial performance, helping to identify seasonal trends and monitor the company's growth over time.

**3. Percent Order Status:**
   This model calculates the percentage of orders corresponding to each order status. It gives an overview of the distribution of orders across different stages, such as "Completed," "Cancelled," "On Hold," etc.

**4. Revenue and Profit by Department:**
   This model analyzes the revenue and profit generated by each department in the Instacart platform. It brings together data from the products, departments, aisles, and orders tables to provide valuable insights into the financial performance of each department.

**Automated Data Simulation**
The automated Python script plays a crucial role in enriching the Instacart database with dynamic and realistic transactional data. By continuously generating new orders every minute, the simulation emulates the vibrant and ever-changing nature of customer interactions in a real-life retail setting. 

The dbt models are designed to efficiently process the large-scale data from the Instacart database, and they can be further customized or extended to cater to specific business needs. The resulting insights from these transformations empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer experiences on the platform.

The project is intended to serve as a foundation for comprehensive customer analysis and strategic decision-making, showcasing the power of dbt in transforming raw data into meaningful and actionable insights for business growth.

All outputs generated by these models are materialized as tables within the prod schema with the fact order table as incremental to reduce the latency of the dbt run, providing structured and optimized data for downstream analytics and reporting. 

This project combines powerful data transformation techniques with advanced analytics to deliver valuable insights and enable data-driven decision-making within the organization.
